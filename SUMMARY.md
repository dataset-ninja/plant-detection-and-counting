The dataset consists of 189 images with 16122 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *sunflower*, *sugarbeet*, and *maize*.

Images in the Plant Detection and Counting dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the INRAe, France, Arvalis, France, ITB, France, and <a href="https://www.hiphen-plant.com/" style="color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Hiphen, France</a>
